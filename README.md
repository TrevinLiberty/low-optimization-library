Low Optimization Library
========================

A library of C++ utility classes written to be as slow as possible, for all your benchmarking needs!

Have you ever finished polishing up a particularly nifty piece of optimized code and thought
to yourself, "Man... This implementation is fast, but there's probably a faster one out there
somewhere." Doesn't it suck to know that there are, most likely, several versions of the same
code available for free online that are just as fast or *faster* than yours?

Well, worry no more! The Low Optimization Library is an open-source collection of containers
and utility classes that will make your own code shine by comparison in even the simplest of
tests! Written in C++ for maximum inefficiency, these containers are guaranteed to be orders
of magnitude slower than even your naivest implementation. Benchmark your own utility classes
against ours for impressive results that are sure to impress your friends! Or, throw a few into
random pieces of code at work! You're sure to look like a hero to your co-workers when you're
able to make huge performance improvements to the codebase with the flick of a keystroke!

The possibilities are endless---with LOL!
